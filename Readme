This is LPC1768 USB-Device (HID keyboard,CDC, mouse,..) example for SEGGER Embedded Studio.

Fully free for non-commercial use, everybody can build USB Device as me...

You can remove form project for example USB_HID_Keyboard.c file and attach USB_HID_Echo1.c ( or USB_CDC_Echo.c) 
and build convenient your own USB device. 

I use SEGGER JLink debugger, Windows 10-64 or Win 7-64, SEGGER Embedded Studio and old board with LPc1768 controller from receipt printer FPrint-55PTK.

Here I have written some steps how to build this project.
